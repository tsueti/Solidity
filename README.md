# Solidity Projects by TSUETi

Welcome to my Solidity Projects repository! ðŸš€

This repository contains a collection of Solidity-based projects and smart contracts that I have developed. My goal is to explore the possibilities of blockchain technology and decentralized applications (dApps) through practical projects and experiments.

## Contents

In this repository, you will find:

- **Smart Contracts:** Various smart contracts implemented in Solidity, ranging from simple examples to more complex projects.
- **dApp Projects:** Full decentralized applications (dApps) built on top of Ethereum or other blockchain platforms.
- **Tutorials & Guides:** Step-by-step explanations and guides to help others learn and understand Solidity and smart contract development.
- **Code Snippets:** Reusable Solidity code snippets and patterns that can be integrated into other projects.

## Projects Overview

1. **Mini Dapp**
